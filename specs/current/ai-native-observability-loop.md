# AI Native Observability Loop

## Purpose

Define the target observability loop that lets Open Design improve agent
quality, reliability, latency, and cost from production evidence.

This is a planning spec. It does not implement runtime behavior. It starts from
the existing Langfuse trace forwarding and PostHog run analytics, then defines
the target loop that adds datasets, experiments, annotation, and release gates
around those signals.

Issue: [#3713](https://github.com/nexu-io/open-design/issues/3713)

## Current State

Open Design already reports completed runs to Langfuse and PostHog. The current
implementation captures useful operational facts:

- trace identity: `run_id == langfuse_trace_id == traceId`;
- run status, error code, failure category, failure detail, retryability, and
  user action;
- timing fields for queue, prompt build, spawn, first token, generation, tool
  aggregate, finalize, and total duration;
- token and cache fields for provider input, effective input, cache read/write,
  uncached input, estimated context tokens, and cache source;
- tags and metadata for agent, model, skill, design system, runtime, app
  channel, operating system, and client type;
- user feedback scores such as `user_rating` and `user_rating_reason`.

The current Langfuse tree is still mostly runtime-oriented. A typical trace is
shaped like:

```text
open-design-turn
  agent-run
    llm
    tool:read
    tool:write
    tool:todowrite
```

This answers "what did the subprocess and tools do?" It does not consistently
answer "which product task stage made the run succeed, fail, become slow, become
expensive, or require human judgment?"

The current project also has far more traces than durable evaluation assets.
That means Open Design can inspect individual runs, but the system does not yet
turn production evidence into enough datasets, experiments, annotation queues,
and release gates to drive continuous improvement.

## Target Model

Open Design should treat observability as a closed loop:

```text
production trace
  -> semantic task observations
  -> automatic scores
  -> agent triage and clustering
  -> dataset or annotation candidate
  -> experiment and regression gate
  -> optimization proposal
  -> human approval when risk is high
  -> release
  -> online observation
```

Langfuse is the trace, score, dataset, experiment, and annotation surface.
PostHog remains the aggregate product analytics and alerting surface. Open
Design owns the domain model that maps a design-agent run onto task stages,
quality signals, and release decisions.

### Semantic Trace Shape

The target trace tree should expose product stages in addition to low-level
runtime spans:

```text
open-design-turn
  brief-intake
  route-task-kind
  resolve-context
    resolve-skill
    resolve-design-system
    resolve-memory
    resolve-plugin
  build-prompt-stack
  spawn-agent
  agent-work
    plan
    generate-artifact
    edit-artifact
    tool-call
  verify-artifact
    preview-render
    artifact-manifest
    export-check
  critique
  repair
  evaluator
  finalize
```

The exact implementation can preserve the existing `agent-run`, `llm`, and
`tool:*` observations, but those observations should sit inside or alongside
semantic task stages so humans and agents can diagnose by product intent.

### Score Model

An eligible run is a terminal, non-test agent run with enough trace metadata to
identify trace id, task kind, agent, model, final status, and timing/token
baselines. Each eligible run should receive automatic scores where the signal can
be computed safely:

| Score | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `task_success` | The run produced a useful terminal result for the requested task. |
| `artifact_valid` | Required artifact files and manifest entries exist and are readable. |
| `preview_ok` | The primary preview renders without fatal runtime errors. |
| `user_request_covered` | The output appears to address the explicit user request. |
| `design_quality` | Automated or rubric-based critique result for visual/product quality. |
| `stability_risk` | Failure, retry, timeout, or brittle-runtime risk bucket. |
| `cost_bucket` | Cost/token use relative to task kind and model baseline. |
| `latency_bucket` | Latency relative to task kind and agent/model baseline. |
| `user_rating` | Human end-user feedback, already reported from the UI. |

Score applicability must be explicit so dashboards and datasets do not confuse
not-applicable scores with failures or evaluator gaps. When a score does not
apply, Open Design should not write a score value; it should record
`score_applicability.<score> = "not_applicable"`. When a score applies but cannot
be computed because required trace fields or evaluator inputs are missing, it
should record `score_applicability.<score> = "insufficient_signal"` and treat the
missing score as an observability gap, not as a failed run.

| Score | Applies to |
| --- | --- |
| `task_success` | All eligible user-facing and scheduled agent runs with a terminal result. |
| `artifact_valid` | Artifact-producing tasks that create, edit, export, or inspect project files with a required manifest or file contract. |
| `preview_ok` | Artifact-producing tasks whose primary output has a supported preview renderer. |
| `user_request_covered` | User-facing tasks with a natural-language request and terminal output to compare. |
| `design_quality` | Visual, product, deck, prototype, image, video, audio, or document outputs with an applicable rubric. |
| `stability_risk` | All eligible runs. |
| `cost_bucket` | All eligible runs with model and token metadata. |
| `latency_bucket` | All eligible runs with timing metadata. |
| `user_rating` | Runs where the user submitted explicit feedback. |

Automatic scores should start conservative. Deterministic evaluators are
preferred before LLM-as-judge. Human feedback and annotation can later calibrate
or replace weak automatic scores.

### Dataset and Experiment Model

Production traces should become evaluation assets through an explicit promotion
path:

- failed traces with clear root cause become regression dataset candidates;
- low-score traces become quality dataset candidates;
- high-cost or high-latency traces become efficiency dataset candidates;
- ambiguous traces enter annotation queues before promotion;
- accepted dataset items retain source trace id, task kind, agent, model, skill,
  design system, prompt stack fingerprint, and expected outcome.

Experiments should run the same dataset against candidate changes such as:

- prompt stack edits;
- skill or design-system changes;
- agent/model routing changes;
- retry and runtime policy changes;
- context compression or cacheability changes;
- evaluator or guardrail changes.

An experiment is successful only when quality, reliability, latency, and cost
are considered together. A lower-cost run that fails the task is not an
improvement.

## Human and Agent Responsibilities

The loop is AI Native because agents should operate the routine diagnosis and
validation work, while humans intervene at high-leverage judgment points.

Agent-owned work:

- scan recent traces and dashboards on a schedule;
- rank failures by category, detail, stage, agent, model, OS, and task kind;
- cluster low-score or high-cost traces into failure modes;
- propose dataset and annotation candidates;
- run experiments for candidate prompt, skill, model, or runtime changes;
- summarize tradeoffs across quality, reliability, latency, and cost;
- draft optimization PRs or prompt/skill changes when the risk is low.

Human-owned work:

- approve production releases and high-risk behavior changes;
- label ambiguous or subjective quality cases;
- approve major system prompt, skill, or design-system changes;
- decide quality versus cost tradeoffs when metrics conflict;
- review annotation queues and calibrate evaluators.

The intended working loop is:

```text
agent finds a signal
  -> agent explains the likely cause
  -> agent proposes data/evaluator/prompt/runtime changes
  -> experiment proves or rejects the proposal
  -> human approves only the meaningful risk
```

## Metrics

The loop should report progress through a small set of durable metrics.

Quality:

- `task_success` by task kind, agent, model, skill, and design system;
- `preview_ok` and `artifact_valid` for artifact-producing tasks;
- user rating rate and negative-reason distribution;
- annotation agreement or evaluator drift where available.

Reliability:

- terminal failure rate;
- unknown or unattributable failure share;
- retryable failure share and retry success rate;
- failure category/detail/stage distribution.

Latency:

- P50/P90/P99 total duration by task kind;
- slowest segment by queue, prompt build, spawn, first token, generation, tool
  aggregate, verify, and finalize;
- preview and artifact verification duration once those stages are observable.

Cost:

- provider input tokens, effective input tokens, output tokens, and total tokens;
- estimated context tokens and uncached input tokens;
- cache hit ratio and cache source;
- calculated cost when Langfuse pricing supports the model;
- fallback cost bucket when a model has no pricing mapping.

Loop health:

- dataset item count by source and task kind;
- experiment count and pass/fail trend;
- annotation queue throughput and aging;
- number of shipped changes linked to observed trace evidence.

## Rollout Slices

### Slice 1: Spec and Baseline

- Land this spec.
- Keep runtime behavior unchanged.
- Document current trace coverage, score coverage, dataset count, and known gaps
  from Langfuse/PostHog.

### Slice 2: Semantic Stage Observations

- Add task-stage observations around existing run lifecycle boundaries.
- Preserve existing trace ids, tags, and low-level observations.
- Emit stage status, duration, and failure metadata so failed traces can be
  grouped by product stage.

### Slice 3: Automatic Evaluators

- Add deterministic scores for artifact validity, preview success, task success
  proxy, latency bucket, and cost bucket.
- Keep evaluator failures non-blocking.
- Write scores back to Langfuse and mirror aggregate fields to PostHog where
  dashboarding needs them.

### Slice 4: Dataset and Annotation Promotion

- Add an agent-operable workflow that proposes dataset items from failed,
  low-score, high-cost, and high-latency traces.
- Route ambiguous quality cases to Langfuse annotation queues.
- Preserve provenance from dataset item back to source trace and accepted human
  annotation.

### Slice 5: Experiment and Release Gates

- Define fixed task datasets for core task kinds.
- Run experiments before prompt, skill, model-routing, retry, or context changes
  are treated as durable wins.
- Gate releases on quality not regressing while reliability, latency, or cost
  improves.

The release gate should use a fixed comparator so the same experiment result
produces the same pass/fail decision across implementations:

| Gate field | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Baseline comparator | Compare the candidate against the latest approved release on the fixed dataset for each affected task kind. If no fixed dataset exists yet, compare against the last 14 days of production traces promoted into the baseline window and block shipping until a maintainer approves that provisional baseline. |
| Blocking quality metrics | `task_success`, `user_request_covered`, and applicable `artifact_valid` / `preview_ok` / `design_quality`. Any blocking quality metric regressing by more than 1 percentage point, or producing one additional critical artifact failure in a fixed regression dataset, blocks the release. |
| Blocking reliability metrics | Terminal failure rate, unknown failure share, retryable failure share, and retry success rate. A candidate fails if terminal or unknown failures increase by more than 1 percentage point, or if retry success drops by more than 2 percentage points. |
| Blocking latency and cost metrics | P90 total duration and total token or calculated cost by task kind. A candidate fails if either P90 latency or cost increases by more than 5% without an explicit human-approved quality tradeoff. |
| Advisory metrics | P50 latency, P99 latency, cache hit ratio, annotation throughput, dataset growth, and user rating volume. These must be reported with the gate result but do not block by themselves. |
| Improvement threshold | A candidate qualifies as an improvement only when all blocking metrics pass and at least one blocking reliability, latency, or cost metric improves by 5% or more, or one documented failure category is eliminated on the fixed regression dataset. |

### Slice 6: Agent-Operated Optimization Loop

- Schedule an agent report that ranks the most important quality, reliability,
  latency, and cost opportunities.
- Let agents draft low-risk improvement PRs with linked trace, dataset, and
  experiment evidence.
- Require human approval for high-risk prompts, guardrails, model-routing, and
  product-quality decisions.

## Relationship to Existing Plans

`specs/current/run-reliability-optimization-plan.md` remains the concrete plan
for reducing failures and optimizing latency/token cost after the first
observability slice. This spec is the higher-level loop that makes that work
repeatable and connects it to quality evaluation, datasets, experiments,
annotation, and human-agent collaboration.

`specs/current/automation-self-evolution.md` describes how successful runs and
sources can promote durable memory, skills, design systems, and automation
templates. This observability loop provides the evidence and gates for deciding
which proposed evolutions are trustworthy.

## Non-goals

- This spec does not replace Langfuse or PostHog.
- This spec does not add a new model router.
- This spec does not require all evaluators to be LLM judges.
- This spec does not implement runtime changes in the spec-only PR.
- This spec does not make agents auto-ship high-risk changes without human
  approval.

## Acceptance Criteria for Follow-up Implementation

The loop is working when a representative production regression can be handled
end to end:

1. A bad run produces a trace with a clear failing task stage.
2. Automatic or human scores identify the quality, stability, latency, or cost
   problem.
3. The trace is promoted to a dataset item or annotation queue with provenance.
4. An experiment compares a proposed fix against the accepted dataset.
5. The result summarizes quality, reliability, latency, and cost tradeoffs.
6. A human approves high-risk changes or the agent proceeds with a low-risk
   improvement.
7. Online dashboards confirm the improvement after release.
